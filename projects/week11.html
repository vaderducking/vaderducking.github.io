            <p>Using <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> with
                <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
            <p>Tools used : Bootstrap, W3Schools, Mozilla.org, StackOverflow, Github, ChatGPT and many more sources and
                documentation</p>
            <p>This is the Final Project of my CS50 Introduction To Computer Science course. I started CS50 in August 2023
                and it has been a long and very fruitful journey that allowed me to learn so much. For the final projects, I
                thought of what to build for a long time and as I enjoyed web developping over the last few weeks of the
                course I decided to build one for my little sister. She has her own business in Nail Art and various other
                esthetic based activities which I don't fully understand. We worked together in thinking of functionalities
                and mostly from a design perspective. It had to look professional and based of her tastes and wishes. This
                is something I had to work on as designing things in general is not something that comes naturally to me, I
                had to learn a lot of CSS and JavaScript with many trial and error to get to a decent visual presentation
                that we both liked.</p>

            <p>To start my Flask web application locally, use <code>flask run</code> or <code>flask run --debug</code> to
                enter the debug mode.</p>
            <p>To update and upgrade the database when making changes to the /models.py file I used the below commands:</p>
            <pre><code>flask db -m "Text explaining the changes"
                flask db migrate
                </code></pre>

                        aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            </div>
            <p>The app contains 7 python files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>init</strong>.py used to initialise the application, database and mail services
                </li>
                <li>routes.py used to declare the different routes and operate back-end processes</li>
                <li>helpers.py used to separate complementary functions from the routes.py file to not overload and make it
                    bigger than it needs to be</li>
                <li>models.py contains the database classes and tables needed to operate the application</li>
                <li>env.py in the migrations/ folder to configure the Alembic database migrations</li>
                <li>config.py used to declare configuration variables</li>
                <li>run.py to create and run the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It contains 14 HTML templates, 4 CSS and 1 JavaScript files.</p>
            <div class="markdown-heading">
                <h2 class="heading-element">Structure of the routes</h2><a id="user-content-structure-of-the-routes"
                    class="anchor" aria-label="Permalink: Structure of the routes" href="#structure-of-the-routes"><span

            </div>
            <p>The landing page route is "/" and simply fetches the necessary information from the database to populate all
                the jinja variables from the index.html template that extends the layout.html template.</p>
            <p>We have the "login" and "register" routes to handle user connectivity, as well as the "/confirm/" and
                "/resend" routes to handle user verification.</p>
            <p>The "/admin" route is decorated with an @admin_required function which checks if the user possesses admin
                privileges, and all the routes that require the user to be logged in are decorated with the @login_required
                function.</p>
            <p>There are many variations of the "/admin/" routes to handle products, appointments, images, folders and
                opinions maintenance and modifications as well as being able to view the users in a table.</p>
            <p>The "/politic", "/terms" and "/legal" routes render the appropriate HTML templates to display terms and
                conditions, legal modalities and confidentiality policies. There is a button at the bottom of the "/politic"
                to contacts us by email.</p>
            <p>Users have the possibility to reset their password by using the "/forgotpw" route using both GET and POST
                methods that will send them an email which will redirect them with a link to the "/reset/" &lt;route.</p>
            <p>Once users validated their email, they will be able to manage their personal information and view their past
                appointments also create opinion cards that could end up on the front page upon admin validation using the
                various "/account" route.</p>
            <p>Finally, the self explanatory "/logout" route will clear the session to log out the user.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-element">Functionalities</h2><a id="user-content-functionalities" class="anchor"
                    aria-label="Permalink: Functionalities" href="#functionalities"><span aria-hidden="true"
                        class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
            </div>
            <p>For now users cannot purchase products or book appointments but this is something that I keep in mind for
                later, my little sister's business being new and her being young is still early for this. For now I focused
                on allowing as much maintenance as possible directly from the web application for any "Admin rights"
                entitled users.</p>
            <p>Chat GPT helped me mostly for Python routes to handle the back end and functionalities as folder navigation
                and image selection from a modal, also for folder creation and overall on guidance to build functionalities
                and understand more the behind the scenes of very simple things.</p>
            <p>A quick tour of the website's functionalities is available on Youtube : <a
